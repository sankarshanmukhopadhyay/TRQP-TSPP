# Roadmap

This roadmap tracks high-level increments for TSPP.

## Completed

- ✅ Formalize AL dependency contract (`al-contract.json`) and clarify canonical AL source.
- ✅ Add standards alignment annex (`docs/standards-alignment.md`).

## Next

- Add machine-readable control registry export (CSV/JSON) derived from `docs/requirements.md`.
- Expand requirements coverage for AL3/AL4 governance + audit expectations (parameterized by canonical AL definitions).


## Release readiness (v0.2.1)

- ✅ Findings addressed: AL contract pinning, template hygiene, and code intent documentation.
- ✅ Release artifacts: VERSION file, changelog entries, and release template updated.
