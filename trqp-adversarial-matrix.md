| Protocol semantics: “DNS for trust”, read-only queries for authorization/recognition | Turn TRQP into a single point of systemic truth (and systemic failure) | Push a “default TRQP resolver” library into popular verifier stacks; market it as “compliance-ready.” Encourage operators to hardcode fail-open. Trigger dependency + operational monoculture; then exploit any resolver bug or outage for broad impact. | Consumers treat TRQP answers as ground truth; shortcuts become policy | Ecosystem-wide false trust decisions; cascading outages                             | Consumer decision logic is out of scope; easy to over-trust          | Require explicit policy pinning, governance evaluation, multi-source corroboration for high-impact decisions; mandate fail-closed vs fail-open policy choices |
| Authorization query (“Has Authority A authorized Entity B…”)                         | Get unauthorized entities treated as authorized                        | Find or induce semantic mismatches in “bridge” adapters: e.g., action/resource namespace collisions. Register an entity with similar identifiers. Exploit parser/canonicalization differences. Replay stale “authorized=true” in downstream caches.      | Bridge translation bugs; semantic drift                               | Illegitimate issuers/verifiers operate “legally”; fraud at issuance/acceptance edge | Bridges + systems of record are out of scope (highest-risk area)     | Golden test fixtures; differential testing; canonicalization rules; signed responses with freshness; cache discipline                                         |

Target verifiers that accept shallow recognition without governance checks. Use social proof + “interop” rhetoric to normalize the chain.     | Recognition chain laundering                                          | Shadow governance; cross-ecosystem legitimacy spoofing                              | Recognition governance constraints not standardized                  | Recognition depth limits; scope-bound recognition; expiry; provenance requirements; audits and transparency logs                                              |

For URL identifiers: domain takeover, DNS poisoning, TLS mis-issuance. Then publish a “valid-looking” authority_id pointing to attacker infra.     | Identity takeover / spoofing                                          | Trust anchor compromise; persistent impersonation                                   | Recommends strong identifiers; no method assurance/rotation standard | DID method allowlists; hardware-backed keys; rotation/recovery ceremonies; CT/CAA monitoring; watchtowers for key events                                      |
| Machine-discoverable endpoints via authority_id (DID doc/service endpoint)           | Redirect queries to attacker-controlled endpoints                      | Modify DID document service endpoints or exploit discovery resolution weakness to inject a malicious service. Downgrade TLS, use lookalike endpoints, or abuse caching of discovery docs to persist redirection.                                         | Silent endpoint substitution                                          | Poisoned trust decisions; targeted fraud                                            | Mentions domain hijacking and DNSSEC considerations                  | Signed discovery metadata; endpoint pinning; transparency logs for endpoint changes; dual control for discovery updates                                       |

Abuse version drift so “issue_v1” is interpreted as “issue” in another stack.                                 | Namespace collision / semantic confusion                              | Wrong authorization; cross-jurisdiction errors                                      | Allows non-global uniqueness; common vocab is “future”               | Authority-scoped namespaces; versioned vocabularies; machine-readable semantics; strict mapping tables in clients                                             |

Use them as a routing oracle to learn internal topology. Feed crafted context values that trigger alternate evaluation paths or edge-case policy in bridges.                          | Correlation + policy bypass via context                               | Surveillance; discrimination; reconnaissance                                        | Privacy warns about correlation; context is flexible                 | Allowlist context keys; sensitivity classification; strip/normalize context; privacy budget + rate limits; anomaly detection                                  |

Use token sharing to scale queries; brute force enumeration under valid auth.                                                           | Token leakage/replay                                                  | Unauthorized bulk queries; mapping; DoS                                             | Requires bearer token; token profile is unspecified                  | Sender-constrained tokens (DPoP/mTLS); short TTL; aud scoping; rotation; least-privilege scopes; key compromise drills                                        |

Use timing to infer existence even when responses are normalized.                                                                               | Enumeration via differential errors/timing                            | Target lists for coercion/fraud; ecosystem mapping                                  | Distinct error cases increase side-channel risk                      | Uniform error responses; constant-time-ish behavior; rate limits; honeypot authorities/entities; alerting on scan patterns                                    |

Use selective outage to induce inconsistent states.                                                             | Tri-state confusion                                                   | False negatives/positives                                                           | Error codes defined; client semantics left open                      | Enforce tri-state in SDKs; explicit policy for indeterminate; consistent caching + retry semantics                                                            |

Social-engineer relying parties with “policy changed” claims. Flood with frequent minor changes to create fatigue.                                      | Confusion + change-window abuse                                       | Exploitable gaps; compliance theater                                                | Governance artifacts discoverable; change control not specified      | Signed, versioned governance with effective dates; machine-readable diffs; notice periods; client pinning to versions                                         |
