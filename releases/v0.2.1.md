# Release Notes — v0.2.1

This release focuses on adoption readiness: explicit AL dependency pinning, control IDs for automation, and standards mapping for security review workflows.

## Highlights
- Adds `al-contract.json` to pin AL semantics to the canonical TRQP Assurance Hub definitions.
- Introduces `controls/control-registry.json` exporting TSPP Requirement/Control IDs.
- Adds `docs/standards-alignment.md` (informative) mapping controls to OWASP, NIST, and ISO references.
- Reduces audit noise by moving fill-in traceability content into `docs/templates/`.

## Upgrade notes
- Treat standards mappings as **informative**; normative requirements remain in `docs/requirements.md`.
